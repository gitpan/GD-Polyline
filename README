GD/Polyline version 0.1
=======================

Polyline.pm extends the GD module by allowing you to create polylines.
Think of a polyline as "an open polygon", that is, the last vertex is
not connected to the first vertex (unless you expressly add the same
value as both points).

The big feature added to GD by this module is the means to create 
splines, which are approximations to curves.
